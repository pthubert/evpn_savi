   <t>
     Source Address Validation procedures have been specified in the SAVI Working Group and provide a set of mechanisms and state
     machines to verify Source Address ownership. The main mechanisms are described in <xref target="RFC6620"/> and
     <xref target="RFC7513"/>.
   </t>
   <t>
     <xref target="RFC7432"/> and furthermore <xref target="RFC9161"/> specify how an EVPN network could learn and distribute IP
     addresses. <xref target="RFC9161"/>  describes a mechanism by which the PE can proxy some ND messages based on this information.
   </t>
   <t>
     In this document, we review how these two sets of specifications and underlying mechanisms can interact to provide Source
     Address Validation in an EVPN network.

  <section anchor="introduction"> <name>Introduction</name>

  <t>
    <xref target="RFC6620"/> describes a mechanism that provides Source Address Validation Improvements (SAVI)
    for IPv6 networks based the First Come First Serve (FCFS) principle, applicable to any type of IPv6 addresses, including those
    assigned through IPv6 <xref target="RFC4291"/><xref target="RFC8200"/> Neighbor Discovery (ND) <xref target="RFC4861"/>
    Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) <xref target="RFC4862"/>.
    According to that specification,  an IPv6 entry freshly snooped on a SAVI device needs to reach the “VALID“ state before traffic
    sourced with it can be forwarded.
  </t>
  <t>
    Another SAVI specification, <xref target="RFC7513"/>, describes a similar mechanism for addresses assigned by DHCPv6/DHCPv4 server. Again, traffic sourced which such addresses can only be forwarded when the address state is “BOUND”.
  </t>
<t>
  Section 10 of <xref target="RFC7432">"BGP MPLS-Based Ethernet VPN"</xref>(EVPN) indicates that a Provider Edge (PE) router may learn IP addresses and advertise them to other PEs.
  EVPN allows PEs to execute a proxy ARP/ND function that is further detailed in <xref target="RFC9161">"Operational Aspects of Proxy ARP/ND in Ethernet Virtual Private Network"</xref>. According to section 3.2 of <xref target="RFC9161"/>, IPv6 addresses should be learnt by snooping Neighbor Advertisements (NA), then advertised in an EVPN MAC/IP Advertisement route, and finally used on remote PEs to perform said proxy ARP/ND function.
  </t>
  <t>Assuming one would want to perform Source Address Validation in an EVPN network, two models can be deployed:</t>
  <ol>
    <li>the SAVI function runs on SAVI switches not integrated with PEs</li>
    <li>the SAVI function is integrated with the PEs</li>
  </ol>
  <t> These two models are reviewed in <xref target='models'/>. Corresponding interactions between SAVI and EVPN are reviewed as
  well in this document.

  <t>
    In model 1, a SAVI device is inserted between client (host or CE) and PE (or VTEP). This first model is straight forward
    and does not require any additional specification. It is presented in  <xref target='model1'/>.
  </t>

  <t>
    The SAVI devices operate as a verification perimeter between untrusted clients (CEs or Hosts) and PEs (or VTEPs).
    As specified in <xref target="RFC6620"/> and <xref target="RFC7513"/>, only validated addresses can inject traffic over the
    trusted perimeter. The mechanisms to validate addresses are specified in these two RFCs. Note that IPv6 DAD NS (IP source is set to
    the unspecified address, see section section-2.5.2 of <xref target="RFC4291"/> ), used by SAVI for validation, can still be
    forwarded by EVPN but are not used by EVPN proxy for learning. Therefore, as long as an address is not validated by SAVI, it remains
    unknown by EVPN.

  <t>
    In this model, the SAVI device and the PE/VTEP can also be colapsed into the same box. SAVI device is referenced as a "SAVI instance".
    The injection happens over an API between SAVI instance and EVPN rather than over a physical wire. Furthermore, 
    only validated sources are learnt per section 3.2 of <xref target="RFC9161"/>.
  </t>

  <t>
    In model 2, SAVI Instance is integrated with te EVPN PE/VTEP,  It is presented in  <xref target='model2'/>.
    In this model it is possible and even desirable to leverage the knowledge of remote IP entries stored in the VTEP BGP tables 
    to make SAVI validation process more efficient.  This is described in section  <xref target='enhanced'/>

  The next section review interactions between SAVI and EVPN for different type of addresses
</t>
</section><!-- models -->

<section anchor="dhcp"> <name>DHCP assigned addresses</name>
<section> <name> SAVI-DHCP  background </name>
<t>
  The <xref target="RFC7513">"SAVI Solution for DHCP"</xref> specification describes a mechanism that provides source address validation
  for IPv6 networks where addresses are assigned by DHCPv6 server.
  The address validation is achieved by snooping DHCPv6 address assignments, which is known as DHCP Snooping,
  or validating discovered address with the DHCP server which is described as Data Snooping process.
  Both processes are described in detail in <xref target="RFC7513"/>.
</t>
<t>
  During DHCP Snooping process and according to associated state machine, an IP entry freshly snooped on a SAVI device progresses
  from NO_BIND to BOUND.
</t>
  </section><!--DHCP SAVI background -->
<section> <name> Interactions between RFC7513 and EVPN </name>
<t>
  The whole DHCP address assignment procedure is performed using IPv6 Link-Local addresses, which are expected to be VALID prior to
  the beginning of this process. The DHCP server or relay can then be located anywhere in the EVPN network without the DHCP messages
  being blocked by SAVI.  EVPN itself does not learn from DHCP, so until the address is assigned, DAD completed and the host
  have sent an NA (response to a lookup or unsolicited NA), EVPN is not aware of the assigned address. After the NA is sent,
  the address can be learnt by EVPN, stored locally by the EVPN proxy-ND, and distributed by BGP per <xref target="RFC9161"/>.
</t>
</section><!--"DHCP assigned addresses -->
</section><!--"Interactions between SAVI/RFC7513 and EVPN" -->

<section anchor="slaac"> <name>SLAAC and other IPv6 addresses</name>
<section> <name> SAVI-FCFS background </name>
<t>
  According to <xref target="RFC6620"/>, any address, used as the source of a packet or showing up as a target of a Neighbor
  Advertisement (NA) or a target of a DAD Neighbor Solicitation (NS), which is not locally known and validated, is treated as
  a TENTATIVE address and a DAD NS (Duplicate Address Detection Neighbor Solicitation) message with this address in the target
  field is originated by the SAVI device and broadcasted to any validated or trusted port. A response received implies a
  duplication and/or IP theft and on the contrary, no response allow to progress the state of the address from TENTATIVE to VALID.
</t>
</section><!--"SAVI-FCFS background" -->

<section> <name> Interactions between SAVI-FCFS and EVPN </name>
<t>
  Main interactions are listed below:
</t>
<ul>
  <li>Sources not validated by SAVI are not learnt nor distributed by EVPN: SAVI does not allow NA to be forwarded (model 1)
  or signaled (model 2) to EVPN.</li>
  <li>During the validation process for a Source, SAVI (ingress) originates a broadcast DAD, with target set to  “Source”
  and forwards (model 1) or signals (model 2) it to EVPN, which delivers it to remote SAVI devices (over the wire or an API).
  Only SAVI devices that have a local validated entry or a trusted interface forward the DAD to enable the target to defend itself.</li>
  <li>In case a response is sent by one of the DAD recipients, it is a broadcast NA (to “all-nodes”), processed by SAVI (egress).
  The source is expected to be a SAVI validated source, and as such, delivered from (egress) SAVI to EVPN for delivery to all VTEPs and finally
  to (ingress) SAVI to complete the validation process of the target “Source”.</li>
  <li>The first NA sent by this Source triggers EVPN proxy learning and EVPN distribution to all VTEPs per  <xref target="RFC9161"/>.</li>
</ul>

<t> The flow below shows two sequences, A and B, with A where Host does not respond to DAD sent by SAVI and B where host does respond.
Sequence goes like this for A:
</t>
<ol>
  <li>Data sourced with S is received on the ingress SAVI instance. An entry for S is created in TENTATIVE state.</li>
  <li>A DAD is built with target=S and broadcasted to all SAVI instances over the EVPN network.</li>
  <li> Only instances that have the entry "S" in VALID state or trusted ports forward the DAD.</li>
</ol>
<t>
  In the absence of a response from HOST, the state of the "S" entry at the ingress SAVI progresses to VALID.
</t>
<t>For B, after step 3:
</t>
<ol start="4">
  <li> HOST responds to DAD with an NA.</li>
</ol>
<t>
  Upon receiving the NA, the ingress SAVI instance move the entry to NO_BIND and does not allow traffic from this source to
  be forwarded.
</t>

  In model 2 where SAVI is co-located with BGP and EVPN proxy table, upon starting the validation process for an address,
  SAVI MAY perform a lookup into EVPN/BGP proxy table, where entry can be 1) not found, 2) local or 3) remote.
</t>
<t>
  If the entry is local, this is an error as it is expected only VALID entries should be learnt by EVPN ND proxy. The entry in the proxy
  table MUST be deleted.
</t>
<t>Other cases are described in the next sections</t>

  As described in <xref target="RFC6620"/>, when validating a source address that is not known in the local SAVI table, a multicast
  DAD NS message is sent to all remote SAVI instances to check for the presence of this address on any of these instances.
  This process can be optimized by leveraging the content of EVPN / BGP tables on VTEPs and "unicast-forward" the DAD to the known
  address owner, if any, more in <xref target="RFC6085"/>.
</t>
<t>
  Depending on the presence of the address in the BGP table and if present, whether the address is active or not,
  there are three possible scenarios as described below.
</t>
<ol>
  <li>Address not found in BGP/EVPN table.</li>
  <li>Address found in BGP/EVPN table, remote not active.</li>
  <li>Address found in BGP/EVPN table, remote active.</li>
</ol>

<section anchor="not_found"> <name>Address not found</name>
<t>
  When the source address that is being validated by SAVI process is not present in the BGP / EVPN table, it means that is was
  not learned on any of the remote VTEPs which indicates that none of the remote SAVI devices have the entry for that source address
  in VALID state. Based on the validation process described in <xref target="RFC6620"/>, in such scenario the multicast NS DAD MAY NOT
  be forwarded over the EVPN network and the SAVI entry MAY move directly to VALID state.
</t>
<t>
  Note that to prevent race condition where a host is VALID in the local SAVI instance but not yet present in the EVPN proxy table, SAVI
  MAY signal the entry to EVPN as soon as it becomes VALID.
</t>
</section><!--"Address not found"-->

<section anchor="inactive"> <name>Address found in BGP/EVPN table, remote not active</name>
<t>
  When the source address that is being validated by SAVI process is present in the BGP / EVPN table, then the multicast NS DAD sent
  by SAVI can be "unicast-forwarded" per section 3.4. "Unicast-Forward Sub-function" of <xref target="RFC9161"/>.
</t>
<t>
  If the address is no longer active on the remote location, there will be no response and the validation process will follow
  the steps as specified in <xref target="RFC6620"/> to move the entry to VALID state. Once the entry is in VALID state, the traffic
  received from that address will be forwarded into EVPN network and the IP address will be learned by the EVPN. This is shown in
  <xref target="mobility"/>
</t>
<t>
  SAVI instance MAY signal the entry to EVPN as soon as it becomes VALID.
</t>
<t>
This would be an example of host mobility use case.

<t>
  Note than, by default, waiting "TENT_LT" (default is 500ms) before moving entry to VALID state will delay mobility by this amount of time.
  Until validation is complete, traffic sourced from IP will be blocked. It is also expected that EVPN will start the mobility procedure only
  at the end of the validation (after TENT_LT) process. This delay can however be improved in some cases.
</t>
<ul>
  <li>If the MACs are the same on both locations, the EVPN MAC mobility procedure may start immediately after detection of the MAC at the new
  location, and traffic from the IP can be allowed "optimistically", to the exception of ARP/ND/DHCP messages that could change the status-quo
  (mac, dhcp lease, etc.) By doing so, traffic will resume to new location as soon as BGP has re-converged, and in case of an IP-theft,
  mobility procedure and/or SAVI validation (whichever comes first) will re-establish the previous situation.</li>
  <li>If the MAC bound to the IP is different from the one already known, the MAC will be advertised immediately, but not the IP which will
  be delayed by TENT_LT. In this case, traffic from the IP or ARP/ND traffic announcing the MAC change should also be delayed</li>
</ul>

<t>
  As in previous section, local SAVI sends the multicast NS DAD to the known (by EVPN, as a remote entry) target but this time,
  the target responds with a multicast NA. The validation process will follow the steps as specified in
  <xref target="RFC6620"/> and move the entry to NO_BIND state. Any NA received on this local SAVI instance from the validating
  port will not be signalled to EVPN and will not be learnt by EVPN ND proxy. This is a IP duplication / theft use case and should
  be signalled through logging or by triggering an alarm.
