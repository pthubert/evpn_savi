Abstract

   Source Address Validation procedures have been specified in the SAVI
   Working Group and provide a set of mechanisms and state machines to
   verify Source Address ownership.  The main mechanisms are described
   in [RFC6620] and [RFC7513].

   [RFC7432] and furthermore [RFC9161] specify how an eVPN network could
   learn and distribute IP addresses.  [RFC9161] describes a mechanism
   by which the PE can proxy some ND messages based on this information.

   In this document, we review how these two sets of specifications and
   underlying mechanisms can interact to provide Source Address
   Validation in an eVPN netwrok.

1.  Introduction

   SAVI specification [RFC6620] describes a mechanism that provides
   Source Address Validation (Improvements) for IPv6 networks based the
   First Come First Serve principle, applicable to any type of IPv6
   addresses, including those assigned through IPv6 [RFC4291][RFC8200]
   Neighbor Discovery (ND) [RFC4861] Stateless Address Autoconfiguration
   (SLAAC) [RFC4862] .  According to the specification, an IPv6 entry
   freshly snooped on a SAVI device need to reach the "VALID " state
   before traffic sourced with it can be forwarded.

   SAVI specification [RFC7513] describes a similar mechanism for
   addresses assigned by DHCPv6/DHCPv4 server.  Again, traffic sourced
   which such addresses can only be forwarded when the address state is
   "BOUND".

   EVPN specification [RFC7432], section 10, indicates that a PE may
   learn IP addresses and advertise them to other PEs.  It allows PEs to
   execute proxy ARP/ND function specified in more details in [RFC9161].
   This EVPN specification details the learning steps for IPv6
   addresses.  According to section 3.2, IPv6 addresses should be learnt
   by snooping Neighbor Advertisements (NA), then advertised in an EVPN
   MAC/IP Advertisement route, and finally used on remote PEs to perform
   a proxy-ND function.

   Assuming one would want to perform Source Address Validation in an
   EVPN network, two models can be deployed:

   1.  SAVI function run on SAVI switches external to PEs

   2.  SAVI function is co-located with the PEs

   These two models are reviewed in Section 3.  Corresponding
   interactions between SAVI and eVPN are reviewed as well in this
   document.

   This document uses the following abbreviations:

   DAD:  Duplicate address Detection
   NA:  Neighbor Advertisement (message)
   ND:  Neighbor Discovery (protocol)

3.  Deployment models

   In model 1, a SAVI device is inserted between client (host or CE) and
   PE (or VTEP).  This first model is straight forward and does not
   require any additional specification.  It is presented in Figure 1.

   The SAVI devices operate as a verification perimeter between
   untrusted clients (CEs or Hosts) and PEs (or VTEPs).  As specified in
   [RFC6620] and [RFC7513], only validated addresses can inject traffic
   over the trusted perimeter.  The mechanisms to validate addresses are
   specified in these two RFCs.  As long as an address is not validated,
   the only messages allowed from the SAVI device towards the EVPN
   (VTEP) networks are IPv6 ND DAD messages (sourced with zero), which
   are not used by EVPN proxy for learning.  Therefore, as long as an
   address is not validated by SAVI, it remains unknown by EVPN.

                        Figure 1: Deployment model 1

   In model 2, the SAVI device and the PE/VTEP are colapsed into the
   same box.  SAVI device is referenced as a "SAVI instance".  This
   model is presented in Figure 2.

   Model2 is fundamentally the same as the model1.  SAVI instance acts
   as a Security wall between untrusted clients and the VTEPs, and only
   allows validated sources to inject traffic beyond the VTEP.  The
   injection happens over an API between SAVI instance and eVPN rather
   than over a physical wire.  Furthermore, only validated sources are
   learnt per section 3.2 of [RFC9161].

   In this model however, it is possible and even desirable to leverage
   the knowledge of remote IP entries stored in the VTEP BGP tables to
   make SAVI validation process more efficient.  This is described in
   section Section 6

   The next section review interactions between SAVI and EVPN for
   different type of addresses

4.  DHCP assigned addresses

4.1.  SAVI-DHCP background

   SAVI-DHCP specification [RFC7513] describes a mechanism that provides
   source address validation for IPv6 networks where addresses are
   assigned by DHCPv6 server.  The address validation is achieved by
   snooping DHCPv6 address assignments, which is known as DHCP Snooping,
   or validating discovered address with the DHCP server which is
   described as Data Snooping process.  Both processes are described in
   detail in [RFC7513].

Internet-Draft           SAVI in an eVPN network               July 2023


   During DHCP Snooping process and associated state machine, an IP
   entry freshly snooped on a SAVI device progresses from NO_BIND to
   BOUND.

4.2.  Interactions between RFC7513 and EVPN

   The whole DHCP address assignment procedure is performed using IPv6
   Link-Local addresses, which are expected to be VALID prior to the
   beginning of this process.  The DHCP server or relay can then be
   located anywhere in the eVPN network without the DHCP messages being
   blocked by SAVI.  eVPN itself does not learn from DHCP, so until the
   address is assigned, DAD completed and the host have sent an NA
   (response to a lookup or unsolicited NA), eVPN does not know about
   the assigned address.  After the NA is sent, the address can be
   learnt by eVPN, stored locally by the eVPN proxy-ND and distributed
   by BGP per [RFC9161].

5.  SLAAC and other IPv6 addresses

5.1.  SAVI-FCFS background

   According to [RFC6620], any address, used as the source of a packet
   or showing up as a target of a Neighbor Solicit (NS) message
   (including a DAD NS) which is not locally known and validated is
   treated as a TENTATIVE address and a DAD NS (Duplicate Address
   Detection Neighbor Solicit) with this address in the target field is
   originated by the SAVI device and broadcasted to any validated or
   trusted port.  A response received implies a duplication and/or IP
   theft and on the contrary, no response allow to progress the state of
   the address from TENTATIVE to VALID.

5.2.  Interactions between SAVI-FCFS and EVPN

   Main interactions are listed below:

   *  Sources not validated by SAVI are not learnt nor distributed by
      EVPN: SAVI does not allow NA to be forwarded (model 1) or signaled
      (model 2) to EVPN.

   *  During the validation process for a Source, SAVI (ingress)
      originates a broadcast DAD, with target set to "Source" and
      forward (model1) or signal (model2) it to eVPN which delivers it
      to remote SAVI devices (over the wire or an API).  Only SAVI
      devices that have a local validated entry or a trusted interface
      forward the DAD to enable the target to defend itself.

Internet-Draft           SAVI in an eVPN network               July 2023


   *  In case a response is sent by one of the DAD recipients, it is a
      broadcast NA (to "all-nodes"), processed by SAVI (egress).  The
      source is a SAVI validated source, and as such, delivered from
      (egress) SAVI to EVPN for delivery to all VTEPs and finally to
      (ingress) SAVI to complete the validation process of the target
      "Source".

   *  The first NA sent by this Source triggers eVPN proxy learning and
      eVPN distribution to all VTEPs per [RFC9161]

   The flow below show two sequences, A and B, with A where Host does
   not respond to DAD send by SAVI and B where host does repond.
   Sequence goes like this for A:

   1.  data sourced with S is received on the ingress SAVI instance.  An
       entry for S is created in TENTATIVE state

   2.  A DAD is build with target=S and broadcasted to all SAVI
       instances over the EVPN network

   3.  Only instances that have the entry "VALID" or trusted ports
       forward the DAD

   In the absence of a response from HOST, entry state at the ingress
   SAVI progresses to VALID

   For B, after step 3:

   4.  HOST responds to DAD with an NA

   Upon receiving the NA, the ingress SAVI instance move the entry to
   NO_BIND and does not allow traffic from this source to be forwarded.

6.  Enhanced SAVI/EVPN interactions

   In model2 where SAVI is co-located with BGP and eVPN proxy table,
   upon starting the validation process for an address, SAVI MAY perform
   a lookup into EVPN/BGP proxy table, where entry can be 1) not found,
   2) local or 3)remote.

   If the entry is local, this is an error as it is expected only VALID
   entries should be learnt by EVPN ND proxy.  The entry in the proxy
   table MUST be deleted.

   Other cases are described in the next sections

   As described in [RFC6620], when validating source address which is
   not known to in the local SAVI table, multicast DAD NS message is
   sent to all remote SAVI instances to check for the presence of this
   address on any of these instances.  This process can be optimized by
   leveraging the content of EVPN / BGP tables on VTEPs and "unicast-
   forward" the DAD to the known address owner, if any.

   Depending on the presence of the address in the BGP table and if
   present, whether the address is active or not, there are three
   possible scenarios as described below.

   1.  Address not found in BGP/EVPN table

   2.  Address found in BGP/EVPN table, remote not active

   3.  Address found in BGP/EVPN table, remote active

6.1.  Address not found

   When the source address that is being validated by SAVI process is
   not present in the BGP / EVPN table, it means that is was not learned
   on any of the remote VTEPs which indicates that none of the remote
   SAVI devices have the entry for that source address in VALID state.
   Based on the validation process described in [RFC6620], in such
   scenario the multicast NS DAD MAY NOT be forwarded over the EVPN
   network and the SAVI entry MAY move directly to VALID state.

   Note that to prevent race condition where a host is VALID in the
   local SAVI instance but not yet present in the EVPN proxy table, SAVI
   MAY signal the entry to EVPN as soon as it becomes VALID.

6.2.  Address found in BGP/EVPN table, remote not active

   When the source address that is being validated by SAVI process is
   present in the BGP / EVPN table, then the multicast NS DAD sent by
   SAVI can be "unicast-forwarded" per section 3.4.  "Unicast-Forward
   Sub-function" of [RFC9161].

   If the address is no longer active on the remote location, there will
   be no response and the validation process will follow the steps as
   specified in [RFC6620] to move the entry to VALID state.  Once the
   entry is in VALID state, the traffic forwarded from that address will
   be forwarded into EVPN network and the IP address will be learned by
   the EVPN.  This is shown in Figure 4

   SAVI instance MAY signal the entry to EVPN as soon as it becomes
   VALID.

   This would be an example of host mobility use case.

6.3.  Address found in BGP/EVPN table, remote active

   As in previous section, local SAVI sends the multicast NS DAD to the
   known (by eVPN, as a remote entry) target but this time, but this
   time, the target responds with a multicast NA.  The validation
   process will follow the steps as specified in [RFC6620] and move the
   entry to NO_BIND state.  Any NA received on this local SAVI instance
   from the validating port will not be signalled to EVPN and will not
   be learnt by eVPN ND proxy.  This is a IP duplication / theft use
   case and should be signalled through logging or by triggering an
   alarm.

   This is shown in Figure 5
